1. Create a Node js project.
-> by using "npm init" in the terminal, it will create a .JSON file.

2. Define the structure.
-> Routes
-> Controllers
-> Models

3. Do the Auth - it will done on User 
-> Two type of user - 1. Admin & 2. Customer
-> In the Auth - 1. Register
                 2. Login - after login user gets "access token". 

We need dependencies:
1. Mongoose - use for database
2. Express - use to create the server and API
3. json web token - use to create the access token
4. bcrypt.js - use to encrypt the data(username & password)

To add dependencies use : "npm install dependency_name"

we work on backend layers in this sequence:
1. Models
2. Controllers
3. Routes
